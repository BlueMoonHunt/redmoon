## **Requirements for an Engaging & Fun SDL3 Music Visualizer App**

This document outlines the requirements for a music visualizer application built using the SDL3 library. The primary goal is to create a visually stimulating, responsive, and fun experience that reacts dynamically to audio input.

### **I. Core Functionality**

1. **SDL3 Integration:**  
   * Utilize SDL3 for window creation, graphics rendering (2D, potentially leveraging GPU acceleration via SDL\_Render or SDL\_Gpu), audio handling, and event processing.  
   * Ensure proper initialization and cleanup of SDL3 subsystems (SDL\_Init, SDL\_Quit).  
2. **Audio Input:**  
   * **File Loading:** Support loading and playback of common audio file formats (e.g., MP3, WAV, OGG, FLAC) using SDL3\_mixer or a similar library integrated with SDL3's audio system.  
   * **Real-time Input (Optional but Recommended):**  
     * Support capturing audio from the default system audio output (e.g., "What U Hear" on Windows, Loopback on macOS/Linux).  
     * Support capturing audio from a microphone input.  
     * Provide clear selection options for the audio source.  
3. **Audio Processing:**  
   * **Real-time Analysis:** Process audio data in real-time to extract key features.  
   * **Frequency Analysis:** Implement Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to obtain frequency spectrum data from the audio stream. The number of FFT bins should be configurable or dynamically adjusted.  
   * **Amplitude Analysis:** Calculate the overall volume/amplitude of the audio signal.  
   * **Beat Detection (Optional but Enhances Engagement):** Implement algorithms to detect beats or significant transients in the music.  
4. **Visualization Rendering:**  
   * Render visualizations dynamically based on the processed audio data (frequency, amplitude, beats).  
   * Target a smooth frame rate (e.g., 60 FPS) for a fluid visual experience.  
   * Utilize SDL3's rendering capabilities efficiently.

### **II. Visualization Features**

1. **Multiple Visualizer Types:** Offer a variety of distinct visualizer modes, such as:  
   * **Spectrogram/Spectrum Bar:** Classic bars representing different frequency bands, reacting in height to the intensity in that band.  
   * **Waveform:** Display the raw audio waveform scrolling across the screen.  
   * **Particle System:** Particles whose behavior (e.g., emission rate, speed, color, size) is driven by audio features.  
   * **Geometric Patterns:** Shapes (circles, lines, polygons) that pulse, rotate, scale, or change color with the music.  
   * **Abstract/Algorithmic Art:** Generative visuals based on mathematical formulas modulated by audio data.  
   * **(Advanced) 3D Visuals:** Utilize SDL3's potential GPU access for simple 3D scenes reacting to music (if feasible within scope).  
2. **Audio Reactivity:** Ensure visual elements clearly and satisfyingly react to:  
   * **Frequency:** Different parts of the visualization should respond to different frequency ranges (e.g., bass frequencies affect larger elements, treble affects smaller details or faster movements).  
   * **Amplitude:** Overall brightness, size, or intensity of the visuals should correlate with the music's volume.  
   * **Beats (if implemented):** Trigger specific visual events (e.g., flashes, pulses, particle bursts) on detected beats.  
3. **Customization:**  
   * **Color Palettes:** Allow users to select from predefined color schemes or create/customize their own. Colors should potentially shift based on audio characteristics.  
   * **Backgrounds:** Options for solid colors, gradients, simple image backgrounds, or even dynamic backgrounds reacting subtly to the audio.  
   * **Visualizer Parameters:** Expose parameters for tweaking the selected visualizer (e.g., sensitivity, bar width, particle count, decay rate).  
   * **Effects (Optional):** Simple post-processing effects like bloom, motion blur, or color trails to enhance visual appeal.

### **III. User Interface (UI) & User Experience (UX)**

1. **Window Management:**  
   * Resizable window.  
   * Fullscreen mode toggle (using SDL3's window flags).  
   * Display basic information (e.g., current audio source, visualizer name) either overlaid or in a status bar.  
2. **Controls:**  
   * **Playback Controls (for file input):** Play, Pause, Stop, Seek bar, Volume control.  
   * **Audio Source Selection:** Clear way to choose between file, system audio, or microphone.  
   * **File Browser:** Simple interface to browse and select audio files.  
   * **Visualizer Selection:** Easy way to switch between different visualization types.  
   * **Preset Management:** Ability to save and load custom configurations (visualizer type \+ parameters \+ colors).  
3. **Settings Panel:**  
   * Access to customization options (colors, parameters, backgrounds).  
   * Audio settings (e.g., input device selection, FFT settings).  
   * Performance/Quality settings (if needed).  
4. **Aesthetics & Engagement:**  
   * Clean, intuitive, and visually appealing UI design.  
   * Smooth transitions between visualizers or settings changes.  
   * Minimize UI clutter during visualization to maximize immersion.  
   * Provide default presets that showcase the visualizer's potential effectively.  
5. **Interactivity (Fun Factor):**  
   * **(Optional)** Allow mouse interaction to affect the visuals (e.g., creating ripples, attracting particles).  
   * **(Optional)** Allow keyboard shortcuts for common actions (switching visualizers, toggling fullscreen).

### **IV. Technical Requirements**

1. **Platform:** Target major desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).  
2. **Dependencies:**  
   * SDL3 Core library.  
   * SDL3\_mixer (or alternative) for audio file decoding.  
   * An FFT library (e.g., FFTW, KissFFT, or potentially a custom implementation if simple enough).  
3. **Performance:**  
   * Optimize audio processing and rendering loops to maintain target FPS and avoid audio stuttering or visual lag.  
   * Efficient memory management.  
4. **Build System:** Use a standard build system (e.g., CMake, Meson) for cross-platform compilation.

### **V. Non-Functional Requirements**

1. **Stability:** The application should be stable and handle errors gracefully (e.g., invalid audio files, missing audio devices).  
2. **Maintainability:** Code should be well-structured, commented, and follow consistent coding standards.  
3. **Extensibility:** Design the visualization system in a way that makes it relatively easy to add new visualizer types in the future.
